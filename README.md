How to run this file.

It is a simple python file where at the end of the code, you are able to change the difficulty requirement up to 10 (You can go beyond this, but it will require an immense amount of computing power.)

By running python hashing.py, the output will give you the number of nonce attempts by each type of miner, under the type of algorithm, difficulty level, and how much faster the quantum miner was compared to the classical miner.
